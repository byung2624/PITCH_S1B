Now that you have seen how the boxes work, we will tell you a bit more about the task you will complete today. <br><br>

In the following series of choices, you will view money amounts delivered at different times. <br><br>

You will see that for each of the decisions you make, one of the two options has been already assigned for you to receive.
You will see <b>"You are assigned to get"</b> above this option, 
which is for an amount of money that you would receive at a set time. If you prefer this option, choose <b>"STAY"</b>. 
<br><br>

The other option is for a different amount of money that you would receive at a different set time. If you prefer the other option, with the header,
 "You can switch to", choose <b>"SWITCH"</b>. 
 <br><br>

<b>Please consider each choice carefully, and choose the option you truly prefer.</b>
<br><br>

<b>One in a hundred participants will actually be paid according to one of their choices (e.g., $40.10 in 2 weeks).</b> That is, if you are that participant,
 one of your choices will be randomly selected and you will receive a bonus for the stated amount in that choice,
 and it will be delivered at the stated time. 
 <br><br>

Other than the first practice item any one of your choices could be the one actually paid out, <b>please make all your choices carefully and honestly.</b> 

<br> <br>
After some of the choices you make in today's experiment, we will ask you a few quick follow up questions about the options you considered. Please do your best to respond to these questions as honestly and accurately as possible.
