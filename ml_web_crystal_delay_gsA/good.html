Now that you have seen how the boxes work, we will tell you a bit more about the task you will complete today. <br><br>

In the following series of choices, you will view two money amounts delivered at different times: An amount of money that you would receive at a set time and another amount of money that you would receive at a different set time. <br><br>

<b>Please consider each choice carefully, and choose the option you truly prefer.</b>
<br><br>

<b>One in a hundred participants will actually be paid according to one of their choices.</b> That is, if you are that participant,
 one of your choices will be randomly selected and you will receive a bonus for the stated amount in that choice,
 and it will be delivered at the stated time. 
 <br><br>

Other than the first practice item any one of your choices could be the one actually paid out, <b>please make all your choices carefully and honestly.</b> 
<br><br>

After you make choices on money in today's experiment, we will ask you a few quick follow up questions about the options you considered. Please do your best to respond to these questions as honestly and accurately as possible.
